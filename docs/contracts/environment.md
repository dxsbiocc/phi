# Environment contract

Version **1.2.1** (1.1.0 adds the `skill` scope; 1.2.0 adds project environments and overrides; see § Changes). Normative schemas:

- [environment.schema.json](environment.schema.json) — `environment.yml`
- [env-metadata.schema.json](env-metadata.schema.json) — `.phi/env.json`

The runtime copies live in `src/main/agent/envs/schemas.ts` and must stay deep-equal to those files. Parsing and id rules are implemented by `src/main/agent/envs/contract.ts`. This freezes L1 of the [runtime foundation](../design/phi-runtime-foundation.md) (§2–§3, §10). Versioning follows [content distribution design §4.4](../design/phi-content-distribution-design.md).

## Purpose

An environment is an immutable micromamba prefix identified by `envId`. Authors declare it in `environment.yml`. Official environments ship one explicit lock per platform; clients install from that lock and do not solve. `host`, `sourcePackages`, and `description` are Phi data. They are not conda input.

## Spec file (`environment.yml`)

UTF-8 YAML mapping. Unknown keys are errors, including conda keys this contract does not define (`prefix`, `variables`, and anything else).

| Field            | Required | Rule                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`           | yes      | `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,62}$`                                                                     |
| `channels`       | yes      | non-empty array of non-empty strings                                                         |
| `dependencies`   | yes      | at least one item: conda match-spec strings, or a single-key object `{ pip: [string, ...] }` |
| `description`    | no       | human-readable string; stripped before micromamba                                            |
| `host`           | no       | Phi extension below                                                                          |
| `sourcePackages` | no       | Phi extension below                                                                          |

## Phi extensions

`condaSpecOf` returns only `name`, `channels`, and `dependencies`. `description`, `host`, and `sourcePackages` are removed before anything is passed to micromamba. This contract does not invoke micromamba.

### `host`

Commands the host must already provide (LibreOffice, Docker, Singularity). Phi probes them and records the path it found. It does not install them.

| Field         | Required | Rule                                               |
| ------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | yes      | plain command name, `^[A-Za-z0-9._+-]+$` (no path) |
| `description` | no       | string                                             |
| `platforms`   | no       | any of `darwin-arm64`, `darwin-x64`, `linux-x64`   |
| `candidates`  | no       | absolute paths to probe, each starting with `/`    |

### `sourcePackages`

R packages with no conda build, installed from a pinned source archive when the environment is built (foundation §3.5). Order matters: an entry may depend only on the conda dependencies or on earlier entries. Installation does not fetch dependencies from the network.

| Field      | Required    | Rule                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `language` | yes         | `r`                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `name`     | yes         | `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9.]*$`                                                                                                                                                      |
| `source`   | yes         | `cran` or `github`                                                                                                                                                             |
| `repo`     | github only | `owner/name` (`^[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+/[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+$`). Forbidden when `source` is `cran`                                                                                          |
| `ref`      | yes         | github: full 40-character lowercase commit sha. cran: exact version `^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+){1,3}(-[0-9]+)?$`, such as `1.2.3` or `1.2.3-1`. Branches, tags, and ranges are rejected |
| `sha256`   | yes         | 64 lowercase hex characters; digest of the source archive                                                                                                                      |

## Lock files

One explicit lock per platform, at `locks/<platform>.txt` (for example `locks/darwin-arm64.txt`).

- A line whose first character is `#` is a comment.
- The first non-comment, non-empty line must be exactly `@EXPLICIT`.
- Every later non-empty, non-comment line is an `https://` URL ending in `#` and a 32-character lowercase md5.

`lockSha256` is the SHA-256 hex digest of the lock after this normalisation: normalise line endings to `\n`, trim whitespace on every line, and drop comment lines and empty lines. A comment-only edit, blank lines, indentation, a CRLF versus LF difference, or a final newline does not change the hash.

## Platforms

| Phi platform   | conda subdir |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| `darwin-arm64` | `osx-arm64`  |
| `darwin-x64`   | `osx-64`     |
| `linux-x64`    | `linux-64`   |

`currentPlatform(platform, arch)` joins `platform` and `arch` (defaulting to `process.platform` and `process.arch`) and returns that id when it is in the table. Any other pair, including `win32`, throws `unsupported platform: <platform>-<arch>`.

## Names and references

Environment names are kebab-case, matching `name` above. Phi-maintained environments use a `phi-` prefix and are named by purpose (`phi-python`, `phi-r`, `phi-nextflow`, `phi-jupyter`). Plugin-local names have no prefix (`viz`). See foundation §10.

`parseEnvironmentRef` accepts four forms and throws on anything else:

| Form                 | Result                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `phi:<name>@<major>` | `{ kind: 'phi', name, major }`. `major` is `0` or a decimal integer with no leading zeros |
| `plugin:<name>`      | `{ kind: 'plugin', name }`                                                                |
| `project:<name>`     | `{ kind: 'project', name }`                                                               |
| `./…`                | `{ kind: 'path', path }`. The path must stay under `./`: no empty, `.`, or `..` segments  |

`<name>` uses the environment name pattern. Examples: `phi:python@1`, `plugin:viz`, `project:default`, `./environment.yml`.

The reference token is the purpose (`python` in `phi:python@1`). The spec file's conda name for that environment is `phi-python`. `computeEnvId` does not rewrite the name you pass: pass `python` so the id is `phi-python-<hash12>`, not `phi-phi-python-…`.

## `envId`

```text
phi:     phi-<name>-<hash12>
plugin:  plugin-<owner>-<name>-<hash12>
project: project-<owner>-<name>-<hash12>
skill:   skill-<owner>-<name>-<hash12>      (1.1.0; owner is the skill name)
```

`owner` is required for `plugin`, `project`, and `skill` and, like `name`, must match `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]{0,62}$`; anything else is rejected so the id always matches the `env.json` pattern. `owner` is omitted for `phi` even when the caller passes one. For `phi`, a name that already starts with `phi-` (the official specs are named `phi-python`, `phi-r`, …) is used without that prefix, so the id is `phi-python-<hash12>`, never `phi-phi-python-…`. Examples: `phi-python-3f9a1c2b7d10`, `plugin-visualization-viz-…`, `project-<short project id>-default-…`.

`<hash12>` is the first 12 hex characters of SHA-256 over the UTF-8 canonical JSON of:

```json
{
  "lockSha256": "<lockSha256>",
  "platform": "<platform>",
  "sourcePackages": []
}
```

Object keys are sorted at every level. `sourcePackages` stays in declared order. Each package object contains `language`, `name`, `ref`, `sha256`, and `source`, plus `repo` only when it is set. `lockSha256` is the normalised lock digest above. An omitted `sourcePackages` list hashes as `[]`. Changing the normalised lock or the source-package list changes the id.

## `env.json`

Path: `<prefix>/.phi/env.json`. Every field below is required. Use `{}` for `host` and `[]` for `sourcePackages` when there are none. Unknown top-level keys are errors.

| Field               | Rule                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `envId`             | starts with a lowercase letter and ends with `-<12 lowercase hex>`                      |
| `name`              | environment name pattern                                                                |
| `kind`              | `base`, `package`, or `project`                                                         |
| `platform`          | a Phi platform id                                                                       |
| `lockSha256`        | 64 lowercase hex characters                                                             |
| `createdAt`         | ISO-8601 date-time with `Z` or a numeric offset, optional fractional seconds            |
| `micromambaVersion` | non-empty string                                                                        |
| `activation`        | `{ set: { <name>: <string> }, pathPrepend: [<string>, ...] }`, captured after the build |
| `host`              | map of command name to an absolute path                                                 |
| `sourcePackages`    | installed entries, same object shape as in the spec                                     |
| `status`            | `absent`, `building`, `ready`, `failed`, or `drifted`                                   |
| `contractVersion`   | `1.<minor>.<patch>`                                                                     |

`activation.set` is the diff of `micromamba run -p <prefix> env` against the sanitised base environment, including variables set by `activate.d` scripts. Later runs apply this snapshot directly.

## State machine

`canTransition(from, to)` is true only for these edges:

| From       | To                    |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| `absent`   | `building`            |
| `building` | `ready`, `failed`     |
| `ready`    | `drifted`, `building` |
| `drifted`  | `building`            |
| `failed`   | `building`            |

`absent` means no prefix yet. A failed build deletes the prefix and records `failed`; there is no half-built environment. Repair moves `drifted` (or a `ready` environment being rebuilt) to `building`. `building` does not go directly to `drifted`, and `failed` does not go directly to `ready`.

## Project environments

Official, plugin, and skill environments are read-only and never change for a
project. A project that needs more packages gets its own **project environment**,
created through `env_request` (runtime foundation §6.3) after the user confirms.

### Files

```text
<project>/.phi/environments/<name>/environment.yml
<project>/.phi/environments/<name>/locks/<platform>.txt
<project>/.phi/environments.json
```

- `environment.yml` is the **base** environment's spec with the extra conda match
  specs appended to `dependencies`, `name` set to `<name>`, and the base's
  `sourcePackages` and `host` kept. Its channels are the base's channels; extras
  cannot add channels or `pip` entries.
- The lock is solved on the user's machine for the current platform only, by the
  same dry-run export as official locks (one `@EXPLICIT` lock with a
  `# download-bytes:` header). Other platforms have no lock; the environment is
  not portable, and that is expected.
- `<name>` is `<base name>-x<n>` (`viz-x1`, `python-x2`), with `n` one more than the
  highest existing project environment of that base.
- The envId uses scope `project` and, as owner, `p` followed by the first 10 hex
  digits of the SHA-256 of the project's real path.

### Overrides

`environments.json` maps a reference to the project environment that replaces it
in this project:

```json
{ "version": 1, "overrides": { "plugin:viz": "project:viz-x1" } }
```

Every resolution inside the project applies the overrides **once**, before
anything else: a skill's `phi.environment`, an agent's `environment`, a session
environment, and the `phi:python@1` fallback (skill contract § 3.3, agent contract
§ 3). A second `env_request` for the same base extends the current project
environment (its spec becomes the new base) and moves the override to the new
name; the old project environment stays on disk until garbage collection. A
missing or invalid `environments.json` means no overrides; an override naming a
project environment that does not exist is reported and ignored.

`project:<name>` references resolve only to `<project>/.phi/environments/<name>/`.

### `env_request`

A core tool for asking the user to add packages to an environment in this project.

```ts
env_request({ packages: string[], reason: string, environment?: string })
```

| Parameter     | Rule                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages`    | 1–20 conda match specs (`name`, `name=1.2`, `name>=1.2,<2`); no channel prefixes, no pip                                                                   |
| `reason`      | 1–500 characters, shown to the user                                                                                                                        |
| `environment` | the reference to extend. Optional in a bound agent session (default: the session's environment); required elsewhere (the main agent's bash is never bound) |

Flow: the engine applies the project's overrides to `environment`, asks the user in
the conversation (packages, reason, the environment being extended), and on
confirmation solves the new spec, writes the files and the override, then builds
the environment with the usual prompt-free progress (the user already agreed). In a
bound session the binding switches to the new environment for the rest of the
session. Result: `{ ref, envId, name, added: [...] }`, or an error saying the user
declined, the solve failed (with the solver's message), or the build failed. The
original environment is never modified.

## Versioning

`ENVIRONMENT_CONTRACT_VERSION` is `1.2.1`. Per content distribution design §4.4:

- Minor versions are additive only: new optional fields, no change to the meaning of existing fields.
- A major version needs an ADR, a deprecation window of at least two app releases in which both versions are accepted, and a migration note.
- Metadata records the `1.x.x` version it was written for.

The 1.0.0 schemas use `additionalProperties: false`. A conda key or typo that this version does not name fails validation instead of being forwarded. A later minor version adds an optional field by naming it in the schema.

## Changes

- **1.1.0** (2026-09-30): envId scope `skill` for a standalone skill's own environment (`./environment.yml`), with the skill name as owner. Additive: no existing id or file changes.
- **1.2.0** (2026-09-30): project environments under `<project>/.phi/environments/`, solved locally for the current platform, and `environments.json` overrides applied before every resolution in the project. Additive: a project without `environments.json` resolves exactly as before.
- **1.2.1** (2026-10-01): clarification — a `phi` environment whose name starts with `phi-` does not repeat the prefix in its id. Before this, `phi-python` produced `phi-phi-python-…`; no environment had shipped, so only development builds are orphaned (garbage collection removes them).
