# Connector contract

contractVersion: 1.1.0

A **connector** gives Phi an MCP server: a remote HTTP server (most catalog entries) or
a local stdio server that runs in a managed environment. Connectors are distributed as
packages (`type: mcp`, added here as package contract 1.1.0), so the catalog can grow
without an app release. Public REST databases are API skills, not connectors (content
distribution design §8.3). See the [package](package.md),
[environment](environment.md), and [enablement](enablement.md) contracts.

## 1. Package layout

```text
<connector-id>/
  phi-package.yaml          # type: mcp, with the `connector` block (§ 2)
  icon.<extension>         # optional SVG, PNG, WebP, JPG, or JPEG catalog image
  environment.yml           # stdio only, optional (§ 3)
  locks/<platform>.txt      # with environment.yml
  <server files>            # stdio only: what `command` runs, when not provided by the environment
```

Package-local icons follow [package contract](package.md) § 4.2 and the
[content icon convention](../content-icons.md). The builder retains the image in the
verified archive and emits optional registry sidecar metadata, so directory-source
catalogs can show icons before installation and installed connectors retain them.
Missing or invalid images use the MCP fallback; no `connector` field is required.

## 2. The `connector` block

Shared package fields (package contract § 1) plus:

| Field                   | Required   | Rule                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `connector.transport`   | yes        | `http` or `stdio`                                                                                                                                                         |
| `connector.publisher`   | yes        | 1–80 characters                                                                                                                                                           |
| `connector.category`    | yes        | one of the catalog categories: `生产力`, `沟通协作`, `设计创作`, `健康与生命科学`, `科研数据`                                                                             |
| `connector.homepage`    | no         | `https://` URL                                                                                                                                                            |
| `connector.url`         | http only  | `https://` URL of the MCP endpoint                                                                                                                                        |
| `connector.auth`        | http only  | `none`, `oauth` (the server's own sign-in flow, as today), or `header` (the user enters a token once; stored like other provider secrets)                                 |
| `connector.environment` | stdio only | `phi:<name>@<major>` or `./environment.yml` (environment contract; a package-local environment uses scope `mcp` and the package id as owner — environment contract 1.3.0) |
| `connector.command`     | stdio only | the program to run, resolved **inside** the environment, or `./<path>` relative to the package                                                                            |
| `connector.args`        | stdio only | list of strings; `${package}` expands to the installed package directory                                                                                                  |
| `connector.secrets`     | no         | **reserved** for stdio servers that need credentials; v1 rejects it                                                                                                       |

Unknown keys under `connector` are errors.

## 3. Install and run

- **HTTP**: installing writes the server into `mcp.json` exactly as adding it from the
  catalog does today (name = package id; `type: http`; `url`); sign-in follows `auth`.
  The `mcp.json` entry records the package id so updates and uninstall find it.
  Uninstall removes that entry; a server the user added by hand is never touched.
- **stdio**: installing places the package under `~/.phi/packages/mcp/<id>/<version>/`
  and writes an `mcp.json` entry built by the managed stdio mechanism: the command is
  resolved inside the environment and started with exactly the execution contract's
  variables, so host variables never reach the server. The environment is built on
  first use with the usual prompt; until then the connector shows as "环境未构建". When
  the environment's envId changes, the entry is regenerated.
- Enablement (`mcp:<package id>`) controls whether the server's `mcp.json` entry is
  enabled. Defaults: catalog connectors the user added are enabled; nothing is added
  without the user's action.

## 4. Catalog

The connector catalog shows `type: mcp` packages from the verified official Phi
Packages registry, user-imported registries, and installed connectors. The official
source takes precedence for duplicate IDs; connector sources are not bundled with
Phi. An entry already present in `mcp.json` shows as added. Entries that need a newer
app version remain visible but cannot be added. Raw directory imports retain
imported trust, regardless of their directory name or location. See the
[official content source decision](../decisions/official-content-source.md).

## 5. Versioning

`contractVersion` follows the content distribution design §4.4: minor versions are
additive only (for example allowing `secrets`); anything else needs a decision record
and a deprecation window.

## Changes

- **1.1.0** (2026-10-08): clarify optional package-local images and registry sidecars
  using package contract 1.3.0. Additive; existing connectors remain valid.
